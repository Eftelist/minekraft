# minekraft
Minecraft remade in Kotlin!

Minekraft is made using [Kotlin's Java interopabillity](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html).

This *should* be compatible with Minecraft, since we're making it in mostly the same way and using the same [packet system](wiki.vg).

Made using the following libraries (which are made in Java):
* [LWJGL](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3)
* [Netty](https://github.com/netty/netty)
