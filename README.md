# minekraft
Minecraft remade in Kotlin!

Minekraft is made using [Kotlin's Java interopabillity](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html), which allows us to use Java classes in Kotlin & Kotlin classes in Java.

This will be compatible with Minecraft, since we're making it in mostly the same way and using the same [packet system](http://wiki.vg).
