# minekraft
Minecraft remade in Kotlin!

Minekraft is made using [Kotlin's Java interopabillity](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html), which allows us to use Java classes in Kotlin & Kotlin classes in Java.

This *should* be compatible with Minecraft, since we're making it in mostly the same way and using the same [packet system](http://wiki.vg).

Made using the following libraries & languages:
* [Kotlin](https://github.com/JetBrains/Kotlin)
* [Java](https://www.java.com/)
* [LWJGL](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3)
* [Netty](https://github.com/netty/netty)
